Recommendation systems are used to filter among a catalog of possibilities, which ones should be presented to the user based on information of the catalog or users. Those systems can be used to enhance the user experience by making the content available to user relevant. In this project, we're going to explore a movie dataset, and present some of the key types of recommendations systems.

Some features of the project are

* Feature extraction and data cleaning;
* A search engine made to navigate through the movie database deployed as a widget;
* Rating-based recommendations;
* Most seem together movies;
* Content-based recommendations;
* Colaborative filtering;
